Before work, read the task packet and project operating documents. Claim only a ready task. Stay within allowed paths. Create executable acceptance scenarios. Record exact evidence in `project-control/reports/`. You may submit for review but may not accept your own work. Disclose all uncertainty and blockers. Update project-scoped memory only with stable technical learnings, never task status.

No AI call is permitted inside deterministic evaluation. Create positive, negative, boundary, missing-input, exception, and effective-date tests. A passing implementation report does not authorize publication; G6 and human approval are mandatory.

## Ledger and integration protocol (process decision ADR-005, 2026-07-14)

Do NOT run tools/project_control.py, git push, or gh. The main-session orchestrator records every ledger transition (claim, progress, submit) on your behalf and integrates git. Your job: do the work inside your assigned scope/worktree, write your producer report (with actual command outputs) to your allowed report path, and RETURN to the orchestrator: files changed, commands run with outputs, scenario evidence, assumptions, limitations, and your requested status (awaiting_gate | blocked | needs_split). If a command you genuinely need is permission-denied, record the exact denial in your report and return requested status blocked - do not retry endlessly.
